  <h2>Tutorial overview</h2>

  <p>This tutorial shows you how to use <a href="http://camel.apache.org">Apache
  Camel</a> to process files and send them to a web service over HTTP. To do
  this, the sample application defines two Camel routes. The first sends JSON
  files directly to an HTTP endpoint, and the second uses MIME multipart form
  encoding for the file upload.</p>

  <p>The goal of this tutorial is to show the minimal code to define and run
  a Camel route that uses the Scala DSL and standard Camel components. In
  addition, a second route shows an example of customising Camel’s default
  behaviour.</p>

  <p>This tutorial demonstrates how little code and configuration is required
  to start using Camel with Scala.</p>
</div>


<div>
  <h2>Application structure</h2>

  <p>The application is simple enough that there is almost no structure.</p>

  <ol>
  <li><a href="#code/src/main/scala/CamelApplication.scala" class="shortcut"><code>CamelApplication</code></a>
  contains minimal code to configure and run Camel.</li>
  <li><a href="#code/src/main/scala/JsonPost.scala" class="shortcut"><code>JsonPost.scala</code></a>
  defines a Camel route that sends JSON files to an HTTP endpoint.</li>
  <li><a href="#code/src/main/scala/FileUpload.scala" class="shortcut"><code>FileUpload.scala</code></a>
  defines a Camel route that uploads XML/PDF files to an HTTP endpoint.</li>
  <li><a href="#code/src/main/resources/" class="shortcut"><code>src/main/resources/</code></a>
  contains a logging configuration file and sample files that you can use to
  test the routes.</li>
  <li><a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut"><code>build.sbt</code></a>
  specifies the Camel and logging library dependencies.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The rest of the tutorial will explain the two Camel routes, and then show
  you how to try them out.</p>
</div>


<div>
  <h2>Sending JSON to a web service</h2>

  <p><a href="#code/src/main/scala/JsonPost.scala" class="shortcut"><code>JsonPost</code></a>
  defines a Camel route that sends the contents of a JSON file to a URL using
  HTTP POST. This route definition uses the
  <a href="http://camel.apache.org/scala-dsl.html">Scala DSL</a>.</p>

  <p>The thing in the route is a string that starts <code>file:</code> which
  uses the <a href="http://camel.apache.org/file2.html">File</a> component to
  define a URI for the route’s message source. For this example, this is a local
  <code>target/incoming/</code> directory, which Camel creates on start-up if
  it does not exist. This URI uses the File component’s <code>include</code>
  option to specify that only JSON files are processed.</p>

  <p>The route itself consists of four steps.</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Define a route ID.</li>
  <li>Log the start of message processing.</li>
  <li>Define error handlers for HTTP errors.</li>
  <li>Send the message to a web service.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The route ID is not used in the route itself, but is output in log
  statements. This gives you a way to identify the route in log statements,
  which is useful for debugging production systems whose log files interleave
  logging from different routes that execute simultaneously. To make this work,
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/CamelApplication.scala" class="shortcut"><code>CamelApplication</code></a>
  enables <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html">Mapped Diagnostic Context</a>
  logging, and the logging configuration in
  <a href="#code/src/main/resources/logback.xml" class="shortcut"><code>logback.xml</code></a>
  uses <code>%X{camel.routeId}</code> in the pattern layout to output the
  route ID. The logging pattern also includes the Camel exchange ID, so you can
  separate log statements for different executions of the same route.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#code/src/main/scala/JsonPost.scala" class="shortcut"><code>JsonPost</code></a>,
  before anything else happens, the route outputs a log message, giving the
  incoming message file name. In a production system, this allows you to trace
  log messages (identified by route and exchange ID) back to the file received
  from an upstream system.</p>

  <p>Next, the route defines exception handlers for whenever the route throws
  specific HTTP exceptions. In this example, the exception handler logs an
  error and moves the incoming file to a
  <a href="http://camel.apache.org/dead-letter-channel.html">Dead Letter Channel</a>.
  Note the call to the <code>handled</code> method, which indicates that the
  exception has been handled and prevents any further processing.</p>

  <p>Finally, the route uses the
  <a href="http://camel.apache.org/http4.html">HTTP</a> component to send the
  current message to a web service, presumed to be running at
  <code>http://localhost:9000/</code>. This means sending the current message
  body - the contents of the incoming JSON file - using HTTP POST. The call to
  <code>setHeader</code> sets a Camel exchange header, which the HTTP component
  translates to an HTTP request header.</p>

  <p>There is more logging around the call to the external web service, because
  you need this to be able to isolate systems for debugging. In production, you
  need to be able to see what was sent and received for an HTTP request.</p>

  <p>In this example, the <code>target/incoming/</code> source directory and
  <code>http://localhost:9000/</code> are hard-coded for readability. In a
  production system, you would use configuration parameters instead, because
  these locations will depend on the machine and the environment - development,
  test or production.</p>
</div>


<div>
  <h2>HTTP file upload</h2>

  <p>The next route illustrates a different use case. Suppose you have a legacy
  web service that is designed to handle file uploads from an HTML form. For
  example, it might use a form like this, which uploads a file and uses
  additional form fields for a file name and date:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;form action="/" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
  &lt;input name="file" type="file"&gt;
  &lt;input name="name"&gt;
  &lt;input name="date" type="date"&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Upload File&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>To send binary file data in the request, the form must use the <a
  href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388">multipart/form-data</a> encoding.
  This encoding handles multiple form parameters, each of which can be text or
  encoded binary. To use this legacy API from a Camel route, you will have to
  apply the same form encoding.</p>
</div>


<div>
  <h2>Adding message translation</h2>

  <p><a href="#code/src/main/scala/FileUpload.scala" class="shortcut"><code>FileUpload</code></a>
  is a second Camel route that is based on
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/JsonPost.scala" class="shortcut"><code>JsonPost</code></a>
  but has two key differences.</p>

  <ol>
  <li>The route processes XML and PDF files, instead of JSON files.</li>
  <li>The HTTP POST uses MIME multipart/form-data encoding instead of sending
  the raw file.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can see the first difference in the route’s source URL. This time, the
  <code>include</code> option’s regular expression matches on two different file
  extensions. In addition, the <code>keepLastModified</code> option preserves
  the incoming file’s last-modified date when copying the file for processing,
  so you can use it later.</p>

  <p>Using multipart/form-data encoding has two parts:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>the call to the <code>process</code> method encodes the message body using
  <code>toMultipart</code> - a custom message processor</li>
  <li>the HTTP request uses the <code>multipart/form-data</code> content type</li>
  </ol>

  <p><code>toMultipart</code> is a Camel <a
  href="http://camel.apache.org/processor.html">Processor</a> that transforms
  the Camel exchange, acting as a
  <a href="http://camel.apache.org/message-translator.html">Message Translator</a>.
  In this context, the processor is just a Scala function with a single
  <code>org.apache.camel.Exchange</code> parameter that gives us access to the
  inbound and outbound messages.</p>

  <p>First, the processor collects file information from the inbound message -
  the input to the processor. For this example, you need the file itself (to
  access its contents), the file name and the file’s modification date. Next,
  the processor uses this information to translate the message and create the
  body of the outbound message.</p>

  <p>To implement the message translation - the MIME encoding - you can use the
  <a href="https://hc.apache.org/">Apache HttpComponents</a> library.
  <a href="https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntityBuilder.html">MultipartEntityBuilder</a>
  has a straightforward API for creating a MIME multipart entity.</p>
</div>

  <h2>Running the application</h2>

  <p>When you run the application, <code>org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultCamelContext</code>
  logs start-up information, including:</p>

  <pre>Route: json started and consuming from: Endpoint[file://target/incoming/?include=.*%5C.json%24]
Route: upload started and consuming from: Endpoint[file://target/incoming/?include=.*%5C.%28xml%7Cpdf%29&keepLastModified=true]
Total 2 routes, of which 2 is started.
Apache Camel 2.13.2 (CamelContext: camel-1) started in 0.580 seconds</pre>

  <p>Camel is now ready to process files. For example, use the console to copy
  the sample JSON file to the incoming directory:</p>

  <pre>cp src/main/resources/test.json target/incoming/</pre>

  <p>This will result in a <em>Cannot connect to the HTTP server</em> error,
  because there is no HTTP server running at <code>localhost:9000</code>.</p>

  <p>The simplest way to make <code>localhost:9000</code> accept an HTTP
  connection is to run the Unix <em>netcat</em> command on another console:</p>

  <pre>nc -l 9000</pre>

  <p>Now copy the <code>test.json</code> file again. Now the Camel console logs
  output from the route:</p>

  <pre>Incoming file: test.json</pre>

  <p>Meanwhile, <em>netcat</em> outputs the raw HTTP request:</p>

  <pre>POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 62
Content-Type: application/json
Host: localhost:9000
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.3.5 (java 1.5)
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate

{
 "quantity": 11,
 "mood": "elated",
 "animal": "elephants"
}</pre>

  <p>However, <em>netcat</em> is not an HTTP server, so it does not return an
  HTTP response, which is why there is no additional Camel logging.</p>

  <p>To successfully execute the whole route, use an HTTP server that will
  return a success response. For example, in
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/JsonPost.scala" class="shortcut"><code>JsonPost</code></a>
  at the bottom of the route, change <code>localhost:9000/</code> to
  <code>httpbin.org/post</code>, restart the Camel application, and copy the
  test file to <code>target/incoming/</code> again. This time, you should see a
  detailed JSON response from httpbin.</p>

  <p>You can test the
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/FileUpload.scala" class="shortcut"><code>FileUpload</code></a>
  route the same way. Alternatively, write a simple
  <a href="https://playframework.com">Play Framework</a> application to
  implement an HTTP server that handles the file uploads.</p>
